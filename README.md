# Visual Explorations

A stash spot for the creative coding visual explorations I've been doing.

## Root Systems

I'm interested in natural forms of branches and roots, and based on a fallen branch I picked up on a walk I asked ChatGPT a series of prompts to explore this. You can find the series of prompts with resulting code examples [here](https://nrrb.github.io/visual-explorations/roots/chatgpt_prompts).
